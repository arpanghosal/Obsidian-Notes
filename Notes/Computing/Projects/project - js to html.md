## Workflow
Converting a JavaScript PDF form into an HTML form is a multi-step process that involves extracting the form elements and their associated JavaScript functionality from the PDF and then recreating them using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. Here's a high-level workflow and the steps you should follow:

1. **Analyze the PDF Form**:
    
    - Open the PDF form and carefully examine its layout and structure. Identify the form fields, buttons, and any JavaScript functionality.
2. **Extract Form Fields**:
    
    - Manually note down or use a tool to extract the form fields' names, types (text field, checkbox, radio button, dropdown, etc.), and any validation rules or special features.
3. **Extract JavaScript Code**:
    
    - If the PDF form has custom JavaScript logic, extract this code and understand its functionality. This may involve exporting the JavaScript code using a PDF editor or converter.
4. **Recreate HTML Structure**:
    
    - Create an HTML file that mimics the layout and structure of the PDF form. You can use HTML, CSS, and potentially a JavaScript framework or library (e.g., jQuery) to assist in creating form elements.
5. **Convert Form Fields**:
    
    - Replace PDF form fields with their HTML counterparts. For example:
        - Text Fields: Use `<input type="text">`.
        - Checkboxes: Use `<input type="checkbox">`.
        - Radio Buttons: Use `<input type="radio">`.
        - Dropdowns: Use `<select>` and `<option>` elements.
        - Buttons: Use `<button>` or `<input type="button">`.
6. **Add Validation and Formatting**:
    
    - Implement any form field validation, formatting, or special features using JavaScript. You may need to rewrite the JavaScript code extracted from the PDF to work with the HTML form.
7. **Styling**:
    
    - Apply CSS to style the HTML form to match the appearance of the original PDF form as closely as possible.
8. **Testing and Debugging**:
    
    - Test the HTML form extensively to ensure it functions correctly. Test for data entry, validation, and any other form-specific functionality.
9. **User Experience Optimization**:
    
    - Ensure that the HTML form provides a user-friendly and accessible experience. This includes handling keyboard navigation, screen readers, and responsive design.
10. **Deployment**:
    
    - Once you're satisfied with the HTML form, deploy it on your website or application.
11. **Documentation**:
    
    - Document any JavaScript code, validation rules, or special functionality you've added to the HTML form for future reference.
12. **Maintenance**:
    
    - Be prepared to update and maintain the HTML form as needed, especially if there are changes to the form's requirements or if new browser updates affect its behavior.
