### Decision trees versus SVMs:
Decision trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are both supervised learning algorithms used for classification (and regression) tasks, but they work quite differently and have distinct properties.

**Decision Trees:**
- Decision trees work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. These splits are made by asking a sequence of questions, which can be seen as a tree-like model of decisions.
- The decisions or splits are typically binary (Yes/No), though they can handle multiple outcomes.
- They are non-parametric, which means that the number of parameters is not determined prior to training.
- Decision trees can be very easy to understand and interpret, and they do not require feature scaling.
- They can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target.
- A major drawback is that they can easily overfit to the training data, leading to a lack of generalizability. This can be mitigated by pruning the tree or using ensemble methods like Random Forests.
  
**Support Vector Machines (SVMs):**
- SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. For non-linearly separable data, SVMs can use a kernel trick to map the inputs into a higher-dimensional space where a hyperplane can be used to do the separation.
- SVMs are parametric, and choosing the right kernel and regularization terms is crucial for their performance.
- They are effective in high-dimensional spaces and relatively memory-efficient.
- SVMs aim to maximize the margin between the closest data points of different classes, which can result in better generalization on unseen data.
- They require feature scaling for optimal performance.
- Understanding and interpreting the final model can be more challenging, especially with non-linear kernels.

In summary, while both are used for similar tasks, the way they approach the problem is different. Decision trees are straightforward and easy to interpret but can overfit, while SVMs are powerful and robust to overfitting, especially with the correct kernel choice, but can be more complex and less interpretable.

# Epoch, iterations, batch and folds:

Suppose you have a dataset of 1000 samples and you're training a neural network for a classification task.

**Batch Size:**
- Batch size refers to the number of samples that are processed together in each iteration of training.
- Let's say you set a batch size of 32. This means that in each iteration, the model will process and update its weights based on the predictions and loss computed from 32 samples.
- After processing all samples, the model's weights are updated once, which completes an epoch.

**Epoch Size:**
- An epoch is completed when the model has seen and processed every sample in the dataset once.
- In our example with 1000 samples and a batch size of 32, it would take 1000 / 32 = 31.25 iterations to complete one epoch. Since you can't have fractional iterations, you would typically round this up to 32 iterations.

**Iteration:**
- An iteration refers to a single pass through a batch of data.
- With a batch size of 32 and 1000 samples, you need 1000 / 32 = 31.25 iterations to complete one epoch.

**K-Folds Cross Validation:**
- K-Folds is a technique for evaluating a model's performance using different subsets of the data for training and testing.
- Let's say you choose k = 5. This means you'll divide your 1000 samples into 5 folds, each containing 200 samples.
- You would then train and test your model 5 times, using different folds as the testing set while the remaining folds are used for training. This helps to get a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on different data.

**Summary:**
- Batch Size: 32 (number of samples processed together in each iteration)
- Epoch Size: 32 iterations (number of iterations to see all samples once)
- Iteration: Processing one batch of data
- K-Folds Cross Validation: Dividing data into k subsets for training and testing

In summary, batch size defines how many samples are processed at once, iteration refers to processing one batch, epoch size represents how many iterations are needed to see all data once, and k-folds cross-validation involves dividing the data into subsets for evaluating model performance. Each concept has its own role in training and evaluating machine learning models.

# Neural Network Terminologies :
- Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is a technique used in neural networks to normalize the inputs of each layer. It helps address the issue of internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of network activations due to the changing distribution of inputs during training. By normalizing the inputs, batch normalization can improve the training speed and stability of the neural network.
 During training, the inputs to each batch normalization layer are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance based on the statistics computed over the current mini-batch.
 
<details>
<summary>   How can batch norm be demonstrated? </summary>
<markdown>
    Let's consider a simplified example to illustrate batch normalization mathematically. Suppose we have a mini-batch of training examples with a batch size of 4, and each example consists of a single feature:
     Mini-batch: [x1, x2, x3, x4]
     1. Compute the mean and variance of the mini-batch: mean = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4) / 4 variance = ((x1 - mean)^2 + (x2 - mean)^2 + (x3 - mean)^2 + (x4 - mean)^2) / 4
     2. Normalize the inputs within the mini-batch using the mean and variance: x1' = (x1 - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) x2' = (x2 - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) x3' = (x3 - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) x4' = (x4 - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon)
    Here, epsilon is a small constant added to the denominator for numerical stability to avoid division by zero. After normalization, the values x1', x2', x3', and x4' represent the normalized inputs within the mini-batch. These normalized values have zero mean and unit variance, which helps stabilize and improve the training process.
    During the training process, the mean and variance are estimated using the mini-batch statistics. In inference or testing, the overall mean and variance learned during training are typically used to normalize the inputs.


</markdown>
</details>



- Epochs: An epoch refers to a single pass of the entire training dataset through a neural network. In other words, it is a measure of how many times the model has seen and processed the entire training data. During each epoch, the model processes the training data in mini-batches, updates its parameters (weights and biases), and evaluates its performance.
    Suppose we have a dataset of 10,000 images and we choose to train our neural network for 50 epochs. It means that the entire dataset will be passed through the network 50 times during training.
    
- Patience: Patience is a term commonly used in the context of early stopping, which is a technique to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It refers to the number of epochs the training process waits to see improvement in the validation loss before stopping the training. If the validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs (the patience), the training can be halted to prevent overfitting.
  Let's say we set the patience value to 5. It means that if the validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs, we will stop the training process, assuming that the model has converged.

- Batch Size: Batch size refers to the number of training examples used in one forward/backward pass of the neural network. During training, the training data is divided into smaller groups or batches, and the model's parameters are updated based on the average gradient computed over the batch. A larger batch size can lead to faster training as it allows for parallelization and efficient use of computational resources, but it may also result in increased memory usage.
  Suppose we choose a batch size of 64. It means that during each iteration, the model will process 64 training examples and update its parameters based on the average gradient computed over those examples.

- Iterations: In the context of neural network training, an iteration typically refers to one update step of the model's parameters using a single batch of training examples. In other words, an iteration occurs when a batch is fed forward through the network, the loss is computed, and the gradients are propagated backward to update the model's parameters. The number of iterations required to complete an epoch depends on the batch size and the size of the training dataset. If we have a total of 10,000 training examples and a batch size of 64, it will take approximately 157 iterations to complete one epoch (10,000 / 64 = 156.25).



# Why parameterize model parameters?
 - reduce time taken for model inference
 - reduce file/model size

![[Pasted image 20230724142836.png]]
For the above, we have 
 input = **Input**((**None**, **50**))  
 dense = **Dense**(**100**)(input)  
 dense = **Dense**(**1**)(dense)  
 dense = **Dense**(**100**)(dense)  
 output = **Dense**(**50**)(dense)  
 model = **Model**(input, output)

For any kind of NN, first thing is to make architecture, then build the model according to it. In an NN, the hyperparameters to tune are the number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and epochs. One can also tune # of layers.
### Keras 
A high-level API, in the context of deep learning, refers to an interface or library that provides a user-friendly and abstracted way to interact with the underlying deep learning framework. It simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating deep learning models by hiding low-level implementation details and providing easy-to-use abstractions. Keras brings in simplicity with syntax and use, compatibility with backends, creating complex models etc. Transitions to other frameworks is also easier.
Keras, originally a separate deep learning library, is now integrated into TensorFlow as `tf.keras`, providing the high-level API functionality within the TensorFlow framework. Enjoy the ease of Keras while benefiting from the extensive capabilities and ecosystem of TensorFlow as the backend.

### workflow of NN
An **activation function is a parameter in each layer**.
  Input data are fed to the input layer, followed by hidden layers, and the final output layer. The output layer contains the output value. 
     The input values moving from a layer to another layer keep changing according to the activation function. 
           **The activation function decides how to compute the input values of a layer into output values**. 
              The output values of a layer are then passed to the next layer as input values again.

Each activation function has its own formula (and graph) to compute the input values.

**Optimizer** - responsible to change the LR (learning rate) and weights of neurons in the NN to reach minimum loss fn.

 Trade off always between LR and epochs, less capacity and memory. More one is, others have to be less. 
      A higher learning rate makes the model learn faster, but it may miss the minimum loss function and only reach the surrounding of it. A lower learning rate gives a better chance to find a minimum loss function. As a tradeoff lower learning rate needs higher epochs, or more time and memory capacity resources.


**Batch size** - sub sets of total training set. If I have X = 100,000 images, i can train in sets of 10,000 ten times. But variance between batches is a major factor to train. However, such batching improves learning and size management. Huge batches/datasets means model building can take time.

After batching comes epoch, i.e. number of times a whole dataset is passed through the neural network model is called an epoch. One epoch means that the training dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.

---

### Backpropagation
Passing a training dataset backward through a neural network is a fundamental step in the training process, known as "Backpropagation".
1. **Forward Pass**: In the forward pass, the input data (training dataset) is fed into the neural network, and the data propagates layer by layer through the network. At each layer, the input is transformed through a series of weighted transformations (linear operations) and activation functions (non-linear operations). Eventually, the network generates predictions or output.
2. **Loss Calculation**: After the forward pass, the output of the neural network is compared to the actual labels (ground truth) from the training dataset. This comparison is done using a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy) that quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted values and the true values.
3. **Backpropagation**: Backpropagation is the process of computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases). It involves working backward through the layers of the neural network to calculate how much each parameter contributed to the overall error.
4. **Gradient Descent**: Once the gradients have been computed, the optimization algorithm (typically a variant of gradient descent) uses these gradients to update the model's parameters in a way that minimizes the loss function. This step is essential for "learning" in the neural network as it guides the model to improve its predictions. 
5. **Parameter Updates**: The computed gradients are used to update the model's parameters using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent or its variants). The optimization algorithm adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, effectively improving the model's performance on the training data.
6. **Iterative Process**: The forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter update are iteratively performed multiple times (across multiple epochs) during the training process. Each iteration helps the model adjust its parameters to reduce the prediction error and improve its performance on the training data.
In backpropagation, we pass the output of the neural network backward through the layers, but we do not pass it all the way back to the original input data (input dataset). Instead, we pass it back to the layers of the network to update the model's parameters (weights and biases) so that the network learns from the training data.

### Optimizers 
Algorithms used to update parameters. There can be multiple, most famous being ADAM, Nadam etc.

# Parts of a DNN
_Nodes_ are individual units within a neural network that receive input from the previous layer and produce output for the next layer. Each node performs a weighted sum of the input data, applies an activation function to the result, and passes the output to the next layer.

_Activation functions_ are used within nodes to introduce nonlinearity into the network output. They are used to model complex relationships between the input and output data and ensure that the network output is bounded and can be easily interpreted.

_Dropout layers_ reduce overfitting in a neural network by randomly dropping out a percentage of nodes during training. This helps prevent the network from becoming too specialised in the training data and ensures that it can generalise to new data.

_Batch normalisation layers_ are used to normalise the input data to each layer of the network, improving the stability and performance of the network. They work by normalising the output of each layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, making it easier for the network to learn the appropriate weights and biases for each layer.

##  Local Minima in a loss function (how to deal)
Dealing with multiple local minima in a loss function is a common challenge in training machine learning models. While techniques like k-fold cross-validation and sampling can help improve the model's performance, they may not directly address the issue of getting stuck in local minima. Here's how these techniques can play a role:

1. **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** K-fold cross-validation is a technique used to assess the model's performance by partitioning the dataset into k subsets. It helps in estimating the model's generalization ability and robustness. While k-fold cross-validation can provide a better understanding of the model's performance on different subsets of data, it doesn't directly address the issue of local minima during training.

2. **Sampling Techniques:**
   - **Random Sampling:** Randomly shuffling the training data or using random sampling for mini-batch training can help the optimization process escape from some local minima and explore different parts of the loss landscape. This is because random sampling introduces more variability in the gradient updates.
   - **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** Using mini-batch gradient descent instead of full-batch can help the model navigate out of local minima more effectively. The noise introduced by mini-batch updates can help the optimization process escape from flat regions of the loss landscape.
   - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** In SGD, a single randomly chosen sample is used for each update, which introduces even more noise. While this noise can help escape local minima, it might also lead to slower convergence.

3. **Initialization:** Proper initialization of model parameters can also influence whether the optimization process gets stuck in a local minimum. Using techniques like Xavier/Glorot initialization or He initialization can help the optimization process start from a better point in the loss landscape.

4. **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Adjusting the learning rate during training can help the optimization process navigate around the loss landscape more effectively. Learning rate scheduling techniques like learning rate decay or adaptive learning rate methods can be beneficial.

5. **Regularization:** Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can have a smoothing effect on the loss landscape, potentially reducing the presence of sharp local minima.

6. **Network Architecture:** The architecture of the neural network itself can influence the presence of local minima. Complex architectures might have more complicated loss landscapes, but they can also increase the chances of finding good solutions.

7. **Optimization Algorithms:** Some optimization algorithms, like Adam and RMSProp, use adaptive learning rates and momentum, which can help navigate the loss landscape more effectively.

It's important to note that while these techniques can help the optimization process escape local minima, there's no guarantee that they will find the global minimum. Often, the choice of optimization algorithm, learning rate, and initialization strategy depends on empirical experimentation to find the best combination for a specific problem.

## Bias - Variance Tradeoff :
Sources:  US ml 2023 Javier's 1st lecture, ask chatgpt.
If L is squared loss, it can be decomposed to two parts while calculating the Expected Test Error: 
E[Lp] = Const. * (Variance  + Bias$^2$)

**Variance** : difference in predictions when training on different datasets. 
Variance in the context of machine learning refers to how much the predictions of a model vary or deviate from the actual target values in the training data. A model with high variance can fit the training data very closely, sometimes even capturing noise and outliers, but it might not generalize well to new, unseen data because it's too sensitive to small changes in the training data.

**Bias** : difference in ground truth.
Bias refers to the error that occurs due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. It's the difference between the predicted values of the model and the true values (ground truth). A high bias means the model is underfitting the data and isn't capturing the underlying patterns well. It consistently misses the target, leading to systematic errors.

Both high bias and high variance can lead to poor generalization and reduced predictive performance on new data. The challenge is finding the right balance between bias and variance to create a model that performs well on both the training and new data.

Example - Robot shooting nicely precise arrows but as soon as you change angle by little bit, it goes off totally wrong. Variance.
Robot consistently shoots arrows with less accuracy. Means in build bias. 

### How to deal with it? Or how to see it?
When evaluating a machine learning model to understand variance, you can consider several metrics and visualizations that provide insights into its performance and potential issues related to variance:

1. **Learning Curves:** Plot the model's performance (e.g., accuracy or loss) on both the training and validation sets as a function of the number of training examples. High variance can be observed if the training performance is much better than the validation performance, indicating overfitting.

2. **Cross-Validation:** Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple folds of the data. If the model's performance varies significantly across different folds, it could indicate high variance.

3. **AUC-ROC Curve:** The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) measures the model's ability to discriminate between classes. If the AUC is very high on the training set but drops significantly on the validation or test set, it might indicate variance.

4. **Precision-Recall Curve:** Similar to AUC-ROC, the Precision-Recall curve provides insights into the model's performance across different thresholds. High variance can be observed if there's a significant gap between training and validation/test curves.

5. **Validation Metrics:** Keep an eye on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., on both training and validation/test data. If there's a significant drop in these metrics on validation/test data compared to training data, it suggests variance.

6. **Overfitting Detection:** Observe when the model starts to overfit. If the training loss continues to decrease while the validation loss starts increasing or stagnating, it's a sign of high variance.

7. **Bias-Variance Trade-off:** Analyze the bias-variance trade-off. If increasing model complexity (e.g., adding more features, increasing model parameters) leads to better training performance but worse validation performance, it's an indication of high variance.

8. **Feature Importance:** Check the importance of features. If the model heavily relies on a subset of features and doesn't generalize well to new data, it might be due to high variance.

Remember that while AUC and other metrics can provide insights, the main goal is to identify a model that performs well on both training and validation/test data. If the model shows excellent performance on the training data but significantly worse performance on new data, it's likely experiencing high variance and overfitting.

Variance can be squeezed, but that means that bias needs to be shifted a bit. There's a trade-off involved in them.

# Autoencoders - huge for anomaly detections


Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used in unsupervised machine learning and dimensionality reduction tasks. They are a specific class of neural network architecture designed to encode input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decode it back to its original form. The primary purpose of autoencoders is to learn a compressed representation of the input data, capturing its most important features while discarding unnecessary details.

Here's how autoencoders work:

1. **Encoder**: The encoder component of an autoencoder takes the input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional representation, often referred to as a "latent space" or "encoding." This encoding typically has a much lower dimensionality than the original input. The encoder network consists of one or more layers of neurons responsible for reducing the input's dimensionality.

2. **Latent Space**: The encoding produced by the encoder network contains a compressed representation of the input data. It captures essential features and patterns in the data while reducing noise and less relevant information. The dimension of the latent space is a hyperparameter set by the designer and can be adjusted based on the specific task.

3. **Decoder**: The decoder component of an autoencoder takes the encoded representation from the latent space and attempts to reconstruct the original input data. Like the encoder, the decoder network consists of one or more layers of neurons, but it typically mirrors the structure of the encoder in reverse order. The decoder's output should ideally match the input data as closely as possible.

4. **Loss Function**: To train an autoencoder, a loss function is defined to measure the difference between the reconstructed data and the original input. Common loss functions for this purpose include mean squared error (MSE) or binary cross-entropy, depending on the nature of the data (continuous or binary).

The training process involves minimizing the loss function by adjusting the network's weights and biases using optimization techniques like gradient descent. Once trained, the autoencoder can be used for various tasks:

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: The learned encoding in the latent space can be used for dimensionality reduction. It can capture the most important features of the data while reducing its dimensionality, making it useful for visualization or feature extraction.

- **Anomaly Detection**: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Autoencoders</mark> can be used to detect anomalies or outliers in data. When the reconstruction error is significantly higher for a particular input, it may indicate an anomaly.
- "We set a threshold for the<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> reconstruction error</mark>. Transactions with reconstruction errors above this threshold are considered anomalies or potential fraud"

- **Data Denoising**: Autoencoders can be used to remove noise from data by learning to represent the underlying patterns while ignoring noise.

- **Image Generation**: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Variational Autoencoders</mark> (a type of autoencoder) are used in generating new data samples, such as generating realistic images.

Autoencoders have found applications in a wide range of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and signal processing, among others. They are a versatile tool for various unsupervised and generative tasks.

# History and advancements in ML:
Certainly! Here's a concise historical overview of the development of advancements in machine learning and their contemporary and later applications and impact:

# Cascading BDTs:
### Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) #bdt
- **Decision Trees:** These are flowchart-like structures used in machine learning for classification. They split data into branches at each node based on certain criteria, with each branch representing a decision path.
- **Boosting:** This is a method to improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It combines multiple weak models (like simple decision trees) to create a strong overall model. In boosting, subsequent trees focus on data points that were misclassified by previous trees.
- **BDTs in Particle Physics:** In particle physics, BDTs are often used for classifying events as signal (rare, interesting events) or background (common, less interesting events) based on various variables (like energy, momentum, etc.).

### Cascading Technique with BDTs
1. **Different Variables for Different Backgrounds:**
   - The effectiveness of BDTs in separating signal from background depends on the variables (features) used. 
   - The key point here is that the variables effective in separating the signal from one type of background might not be as effective for a different background. 
   - By using a cascading approach, different BDTs can be sequentially applied, each optimized to separate the signal from a specific type of background using the most effective variables for that separation.

2. **Dealing with Overlapping Signal and Background:**
   - Sometimes, a significant portion of the signal might be deeply mixed with a copious (very common) background, making it challenging to use this portion effectively in training BDTs for other backgrounds.
   - The cascading method first employs a BDT to isolate this copious background, thereby enhancing the quality of the remaining data (signal and other backgrounds) for further analysis.

3. **Purification of Background Samples:**
   - In each step of the cascade, a BDT purifies the sample by isolating one background type. 
   - This leads to separate datasets, each enriched with a specific background type. 
   - Such purified datasets allow for more accurate modeling (fitting) and analysis of each background type using the data.

4. **Statistical Power and Constrained Fitting:**
   - This method enhances the statistical power of the search, meaning it increases the likelihood of correctly identifying signal events and reduces false positives (misidentifying background events as signal).
   - Moreover, with purified samples, each background can be individually fitted and analyzed with greater precision, as opposed to dealing with an aggregated mix of backgrounds.

In conclusion, when cascading BDTs are used in particle physics searches, they sequentially focus on different aspects of the data, optimizing the separation of signal from various backgrounds and improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This technique is particularly powerful in complex scenarios where different backgrounds overlap with the signal in different ways.

# Boosted Decision Trees, Random forests, Gradient boosting 
Decision trees, boosted decision trees (BDTs), gradient boosting, and random forests are all machine learning techniques that are primarily used for classification and regression tasks. They are related in that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">they all use decision trees as the base learner but differ in how they ensemble these trees to improve the model's performance</mark>. Let's discuss each and their relationship, hyperparameters, and considerations including overfitting.

### Decision Trees

- **Basics**: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature(or attribute), each branch represents a decision(rule), and each leaf node represents the outcome. The top node is known as the root node.
- **Splitting Criteria**: Decision trees use metrics like Gini impurity or entropy for classification and variance reduction for regression to split nodes.
- **Pruning**: To avoid overfitting, decision trees can be pruned by setting a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples required at a leaf node.
- **Hyperparameters**: Maximum depth of the tree, minimum samples for a node split, minimum samples for a leaf node, maximum number of leaf nodes, etc.

### Random Forest

- **Basics**: A random forest is an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ensemble learning method</mark> that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
- **Reduction of Overfitting**: By averaging multiple trees, random forests tend to overfit less than individual decision trees.
- **Hyperparameters**: Number of trees, maximum depth of trees, minimum samples for a node split, minimum samples for a leaf node, and max features to consider for the best split.
#### How the Random Forest Works:

1. **Training**: During training, each tree in the Random Forest is built from a random sample of the training data. This introduces diversity in the models, as each tree sees slightly different data and hence learns different rules.
    
2. **Prediction**: When we want to make a prediction (say we have a new, unseen picture), each tree in the Random Forest makes its own prediction based on the rules it learned during training. Some might say "cat," while others might say "dog."
    

##### The Voting Process:

Now, let's assume our Random Forest consists of 5 decision trees. We present the new picture to our model, and the individual trees give the following predictions:

- Tree 1: Dog
- Tree 2: Cat
- Tree 3: Dog
- Tree 4: Dog
- Tree 5: Cat

Now, we need to decide on the final output of the Random Forest model. This is where the "voting" comes into play:

- **For Classification (Random Forest)**: We count the votes for each class. In our case, "Dog" receives 3 votes and "Cat" receives 2 votes. The class with the most votes (the mode) is chosen as the final prediction. So, in this example, the Random Forest would classify the picture as "Dog."

### Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)

- **Basics**: BDTs are an ensemble technique that builds decision trees sequentially, where each subsequent tree aims to reduce the errors of the previous trees. The trees are built in a manner where each new tree is focused on correcting the mistakes made by previously trained trees.
- **Hyperparameters**: Number of trees, learning rate, maximum depth of individual trees, loss function, and subsampling rate.
- **Difference from Other ML Techniques**: BDTs focus on improving the predictions by reducing bias and variance through sequential learning and are particularly powerful for handling imbalanced data. They differ in their emphasis on correcting the predecessor's errors and in the way they combine the output of individual trees.

### Gradient Boosting

- **Basics**: Gradient boosting is a type of machine learning boosting. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">It relies on the intuition that the best possible next model, when combined with previous models, minimizes the overall prediction error</mark>. It uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss.
- **Difference from BDTs**: While both are boosting techniques, gradient boosting differs in the way it allows optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions and in how it builds trees in a greedy manner.
- **Hyperparameters**: Learning rate, number of trees, maximum depth of individual trees, subsampling rate, loss function.

### Caveats and Considerations for BDTs and Gradient Boosting:

1. **Overfitting**: Although individual trees are prone to overfitting, ensemble methods like BDTs and gradient boosting can mitigate this. However, if the number of trees is too large or the trees are too deep, these models can still overfit.
2. **Computational Complexity**: BDTs and especially gradient boosting can be computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of boosting. They are not as parallelizable as random forests.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: These models come with a number of hyperparameters (like the number of trees, depth of trees, learning rate) that need careful tuning to prevent overfitting and underfitting.

### Regularization Techniques:

- **For Decision Trees**: Pruning techniques, setting maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf are traditional ways to regularize decision trees.
- **For BDTs and Gradient Boosting**: Apart from the number of trees and depth, learning rate (also known as shrinkage) acts as a regularization parameter. Lower learning rate values generally lead to better generalization. Also, subsampling (stochastic gradient boosting) introduces randomness into the model and can help prevent overfitting.




In BDTs, the trees (estimators) are added sequentially. Here's how it works:

1. **First Estimator**: The first tree is trained on the entire dataset and makes its predictions.
    
2. **Subsequent Estimators**: Each subsequent tree is trained on the residuals of the previous trees – essentially, it's learning to correct the mistakes of the ensemble of trees that came before it.
    
3. **Combining Estimators**: The predictions of individual trees are then combined through a weighted sum to produce the final prediction. The weight of each tree's prediction is determined by the learning rate and the tree's performance.

### Hyperparameters Related to Estimators in BDTs:

- **Number of Estimators (`n_estimators`)**: This hyperparameter defines the maximum number of trees (estimators) to be added to the model. Too few trees can lead to underfitting, while too many can lead to overfitting. It's one of the key parameters to tune.
    
- **Learning Rate**: This parameter scales the contribution of each tree. If you set it to a low value, you'll need more trees in the model to fit the training data, but the predictions will usually generalize better to new data.



In Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) and similar ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting, each subsequent tree is trained based on the errors or residuals made by the ensemble of previous trees. This process involves calculating a loss (or cost) function that quantifies the mistakes made by the current ensemble. Here's how the process typically works:

1. **Initial Model**: The first tree (base estimator) is trained on the entire dataset and makes its predictions. The predictions are compared with the true values, and a loss function is calculated based on the difference.

2. **Subsequent Trees**:
    - **Calculating Residuals or Gradients**: For each subsequent tree, the residuals (or the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the predictions) are calculated. Residuals represent the difference between the observed values and the predictions made by the current ensemble of trees.
    - **Training on Residuals**: The next tree is then trained not on the original dataset but on these residuals. Essentially, it's learning to predict the error of the ensemble so far.
    - **Updating Predictions**: The predictions from this new tree are then scaled by a factor (the learning rate) and added to the predictions of the existing ensemble. This process incrementally improves the model by correcting the errors made by the previous ensemble of trees.

3. **Loss Function**:
    - The choice of loss function can vary depending on the problem at hand (e.g., mean squared error for regression, logarithmic loss for classification).
    - After each tree is added, the loss function is used to assess how well the ensemble is performing. It provides a quantitative measure of the difference between the predicted and true values.

4. **Iterative Improvement**:
    - This process is repeated, with each new tree focusing on the mistakes of the ensemble thus far.
    - The model's predictions become more accurate incrementally as each tree targets the most significant sources of error in the predictions made by the previous ensemble.

5. **Learning Rate**:
    - The learning rate scales the contribution of each tree. A smaller learning rate means the model corrects its mistakes more cautiously, potentially requiring more trees but often leading to better generalization.

6. **Early Stopping**:
    - To prevent overfitting, the training process can include early stopping, where the addition of new trees is halted if the improvement in the model's performance (as measured by the loss function on a validation set) does not exceed a certain threshold over several rounds of training.

In summary, in BDTs and Gradient Boosting, each subsequent tree is informed about the previous trees' errors through the residuals or the gradient of the loss function. The trees work together, each focusing on correcting the ensemble's most significant mistakes, leading to a powerful model that can capture complex patterns in the data.


## Gini Index measure to split into nodes:
The Gini index is a measure used in decision trees, particularly in classification problems, to determine how to split the data at each node in the tree. It's a way of quantifying how "pure" a node is, with regard to the classes of the data points it contains.

### Understanding the Gini Index:

1. **What it Measures**: The Gini index measures the probability of a randomly chosen data point being incorrectly labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the node. A lower Gini index indicates a higher purity of the node (i.e., most data points in the node belong to the same class).

2. **Calculation**: For a set of classes, the Gini index is calculated as:
   \[ \text{Gini} = 1 - \sum (\text{probability of class})^2 \]
   This sum runs over all classes. The probability of each class is the proportion of data points in the node belonging to that class.

### Example:

Imagine you're building a decision tree to classify animals into two classes: "Bird" and "Mammal." You have a dataset where each animal is described by features like "Has Wings," "Can Fly," etc.

- **Initial Node (Root)**: Suppose you have 10 animals - 6 Birds and 4 Mammals.
  - The probability of picking a Bird is \( \frac{6}{10} \) and a Mammal is \( \frac{4}{10} \).
  - The Gini index for the root node is \( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{6}{10}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4}{10}\right)^2\right) = 0.48 \).

- **Splitting on a Feature (e.g., "Has Wings")**: 
  - If you split the data on the feature "Has Wings," you might end up with two nodes.
  - Node 1 (Animals with Wings): 6 Birds, 0 Mammals. The Gini index is \( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{6}{6}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{0}{6}\right)^2\right) = 0 \). This node is pure.
  - Node 2 (Animals without Wings): 0 Birds, 4 Mammals. The Gini index here is also 0, another pure node.

### Using Gini Index in Decision Trees:

- When building a decision tree, you want to split the data in a way that results in the purest possible child nodes.
- At each step, the decision tree algorithm considers all possible splits across all features and calculates the Gini index for each potential split.
- The split that results in the lowest weighted Gini index for the child nodes is chosen. The "weight" here refers to the proportion of data points that would fall into each child node.
- This process continues recursively, creating a tree structure where each split is chosen to maximize the purity of the resulting child nodes, based on the Gini index.

In summary, the Gini index is a straightforward and effective way to measure the purity of nodes in a decision tree and to decide on the best way to split the data at each step in the tree-building process. It helps ensure that the final tree is good at correctly classifying the data points.

To determine how a node in a decision tree would be split using the Gini index as the criterion, given your dataset with two variables (photon pT and lepton pT) and their classifications (signal or background), we need to calculate the Gini index for each potential split. Let's work through this with your data.

### Your Data:

1. **Photon pT** (in GeV): 20 (sig), 30 (bkg), 50 (bkg)
2. **Lepton pT** (in GeV): 14 (bkg), 16 (bkg), 20 (sig)

### Steps to Determine the Split:

1. **Calculate the Gini Index for Each Split**:
   - We need to consider potential splits for both variables. 
   - A split involves dividing the data into two groups based on a threshold. For instance, a split for photon pT at 25 GeV would divide the data into {20} and {30, 50}.

2. **Photon pT Possible Splits**:
   - Split at 25 GeV: 
     - Left Node: {20} (1 sig, 0 bkg)
     - Right Node: {30, 50} (0 sig, 2 bkg)
   - Split at 40 GeV:
     - Left Node: {20, 30} (1 sig, 1 bkg)
     - Right Node: {50} (0 sig, 1 bkg)
   - We calculate the Gini index for each of these splits.

3. **Lepton pT Possible Splits**:
   - Similar to Photon pT, we consider splits, like at 15 GeV and 18 GeV.

4. **Calculate Gini Index for Each Node**:
   - For a node with 's' signal and 'b' background, Gini index = \( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{s}{s+b}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{s+b}\right)^2\right) \)
   - Calculate this for each node created by each split.

5. **Weighted Gini Index for Splits**:
   - Weight each node's Gini index by the proportion of total samples in the node.
   - Combine the weighted Gini indices of the two nodes to get the Gini index for the split.

6. **Choose the Best Split**:
   - The split with the lowest weighted Gini index is chosen as the best split.

### Illustrative Calculation:

Let's do one calculation as an example. Suppose we're considering the split of Photon pT at 25 GeV:

- **Left Node** (20 GeV, 1 sig, 0 bkg): Gini = \( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{1}{1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{0}{1}\right)^2\right) = 0 \)
- **Right Node** (30, 50 GeV, 0 sig, 2 bkg): Gini = \( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{0}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{2}\right)^2\right) = 0 \)
- **Weighted Gini for Split**: (1/3)\( \times \)0 + (2/3)\( \times \)0 = 0

You would perform similar calculations for each potential split in both Photon pT and Lepton pT, then choose the split with the lowest weighted Gini index. 

Note: This is a simplified illustration, assuming binary splits. In practice, decision tree algorithms can consider more complex splitting strategies, especially when dealing with continuous variables.

No problem! Let's clarify how the weighting in the Gini index calculation is done using your example of splitting Photon pT at 40 GeV. This will involve calculating the Gini index for each of the resulting nodes and then computing the weighted Gini index for the split.

### Given Data:

**Photon pT** (in GeV): 20 (sig), 30 (bkg), 50 (bkg)

### Split at 40 GeV:

- **Left Node**: {20 (sig), 30 (bkg)} – Two events, one signal and one background.
- **Right Node**: {50 (bkg)} – One event, all background.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate Gini Index for Each Node**:
   - **Left Node** (1 sig, 1 bkg):
     \[ \text{Gini} = 1 - \left( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \right) = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \right) = 0.5 \]
   - **Right Node** (0 sig, 1 bkg):
     \[ \text{Gini} = 1 - \left( \left( \frac{0}{1} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{1} \right)^2 \right) = 1 - \left( 0 + 1 \right) = 0 \]

2. **Weight the Gini Index of Each Node**:
   - The weight for each node's Gini index is based on the number of events in the node divided by the total number of events.
   - **Left Node Weight**: 2 events out of 3 total events, so the weight is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - **Right Node Weight**: 1 event out of 3 total events, so the weight is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Calculate the Weighted Gini Index for the Split**:
   - Weighted Gini for Left Node: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 0.5 = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Weighted Gini for Right Node: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 0 = 0 \)
   - Total Weighted Gini for the Split: \( \frac{1}{3} + 0 = \frac{1}{3} \)

The weighted Gini index for splitting Photon pT at 40 GeV is \( \frac{1}{3} \). This value would be compared with the weighted Gini index for other potential splits. The split that results in the lowest weighted Gini index is considered the best for dividing the data at that particular node in the decision tree. 

This method ensures that splits which affect more data points (i.e., nodes with more events) have a greater influence on the overall decision of where to split.

# Core Dataset creation:
Creating a core dataset for training large models, especially in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence, involves several crucial steps and considerations. The process is designed to ensure that the dataset is representative, comprehensive, and suitable for the specific goals of the model. Here's an overview of how such a dataset might be created:

1. **Define Objectives:**
   - **Purpose of the Model:** Clearly define what the model is intended to do. This guides the type of data you'll need.
   - **Problem Type:** Determine whether the model is for classification, regression, clustering, etc., as this influences the nature of the dataset.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - **Sources:** Identify and gather data from various sources relevant to the model's objectives. This can include public datasets, proprietary data, web scraping, sensors, surveys, etc.
   - **Volume:** For large models, especially deep learning models, a substantial amount of data is typically required. The "big data" can come from various sources and may include text, images, audio, video, etc.

3. **Data Diversity and Representation:**
   - Ensure the dataset is diverse and representative of the real-world scenarios where the model will be applied. This is crucial to avoid biases and to make the model robust and reliable.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - **Cleaning:** Address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
   - **Preprocessing:** Depending on the model, this might include normalizing or standardizing data, encoding categorical variables, resizing images, segmenting text, tokenization, etc.

5. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   - Identify the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model.
   - Create new features through feature engineering to improve model performance.

6. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split ratio might be 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test.

7. **Data Labeling (for Supervised Learning):**
   - If the model is a supervised learning model, ensure that the data is accurately labeled. This can be a labor-intensive process, especially for large datasets.

8. **Data Augmentation (Optional):**
   - For certain types of data, especially images and audio, data augmentation techniques (like rotation, flipping, scaling for images) can be used to artificially expand the training dataset.

9. **Ethical and Legal Considerations:**
   - Ensure that the dataset complies with legal standards, including privacy laws and intellectual property rights.
   - Consider ethical aspects, such as fairness, transparency, and avoiding biases in the data.

10. **Review and Iteration:**
   - Continuously review and iterate the dataset, especially based on model performance and feedback.
   - Update the dataset periodically to reflect new data, changes in the problem domain, or to improve model accuracy and generalizability.

11. **Documentation:**
   - Document the dataset creation process, including sources, preprocessing steps, labeling methodology, and any issues or anomalies. This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.

Creating a core dataset for large model training is a dynamic and iterative process. It requires a balance between the available data, the computational resources, and the specific objectives of the model. Due to the size and complexity of the data, automation tools and scalable data processing technologies are often employed.

TensorFlow is the most popular backend for Keras, providing the necessary computational power. Essentially, Keras sends instructions to TensorFlow (the backend), which executes them. </mark>This setup allows you to write code in Keras at a high level without worrying about the intricate details of the underlying computations.

Originally, Keras supported multiple backends, like Theano and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), in addition to TensorFlow. However, since the release of TensorFlow 2.0, Keras has been included as an integral part of TensorFlow, and TensorFlow serves as its default and primary backend. This integration has made it easier for developers to build and deploy machine learning models, as they can enjoy the simplicity of Keras with the robustness and flexibility of TensorFlow directly.

- How did it start? With perceptrons of course. GLMs were used for modeling, and are still used for regression based neural networks. Ppl were using symbolic ways in AI, like NNs, but they lost favour around the time because probabilistic systems were... limited by statistics. i.e. not much data. Then however, [[Backpropagation]] came.
- By 1990s ppl had collected more data and had started using methods such as fuzzy logic (truth values lie between 0 to 1 in various degrees, unlike only 2 of binary logic), probab. theories etc.
- ML has been relevant to major fields of research - AI, data compression (TF, openCV, k-means clustering in unsupervised ML), data mining (discovering unknown properties of data), generalization of algorithms (for them to be able to work with unknown data), Statistics (overlapping being data science).
- Bias-Variance trade-off is a way of generalization of error, since data is limited and future is uncertain. So efforts from computational learning theories are also limited in that sense.
- P=NP problem - "whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (NP) can also be quickly solved (P)." 
- Approaches to ML - NO single algorithm works for all problems.
  1. supervised learning - figure out input to output mapping.
  2. unsupervised learning - no labels here; find structure in the data. Eg. VAE.
  3. reinforcement learning - machine interacts and learns from environment.
- Different models are used as mathematical constructs comprising a set of parameters and structure. A model can mean a class of learning algos like random forests; a learning algo with pre-set hyperparameters like NN, and a fully trained model with internal parameters tuned after training on the dataset.
- Various models are used for various purposes with various pros and cons. 
- Ah, I see! Let's categorize some of these models and techniques according to the type of learning they're primarily associated with:

#### Supervised Learning
- **ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)**: Basic form of neural networks used for both classification and regression tasks.
- **DNN (Deep Neural Networks)**: More complex neural networks with multiple hidden layers that can capture deep hierarchical patterns in data.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Specialized for processing structured grid data such as images, used extensively in image recognition and classification tasks.
- **Boosting**: An ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong learner. Examples include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and XGBoost, often used for classification and regression.

#### Unsupervised Learning
- **VAE (Variational Autoencoders)**: Generative models that learn to encode input data into a compressed representation and reconstruct the input from this representation, used for tasks like generating new data samples.
- **Generative AI/Models**: This includes GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) as well, which learn to generate new data samples that are similar to the training data, without being explicitly told how to do so.

#### Reinforcement Learning
- **Stable Diffusion**: While primarily known as a generative model, aspects of reinforcement learning can be involved in tuning or guiding generative models towards desired outputs through reward feedback mechanisms.
  
#### Mixed/Other Categories
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**: Designed for sequential or temporal data (e.g., time series, language). They can be used in both supervised learning contexts (e.g., sequence prediction, language translation) and unsupervised learning contexts (e.g., learning representations of sequences without labeled outcomes).

# Transformers - Q,K,V

![[Pasted image 20240430122239.png]]

The concept of attention, specifically the "Q, K, V Softmax Attention" mechanism, is a key component in many modern machine learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). This method helps models pay "<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">attention</mark>" to the most relevant parts of the input data when performing a task.

Let's break down the components and the formula step-by-step in a more approachable way:

## Components of the Attention Mechanism
- **Q (Query)**: Represents the current item or word being processed. Think of it as the item looking for information.
- **K (Key)**: Represents the items or words in the memory (could be the same as the input sequence or different). The key is what the query uses to seek out information.
- **V (Value)**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">These are the actual pieces of information tied to each key. </mark>Once a key is deemed relevant to the query, its corresponding value is what actually gets used.

## The Softmax Attention Formula
The attention mechanism works by calculating a score that determines how much each part of the input data should contribute to the final output. Here’s how it generally works:

1. **Dot Product of Q and K**: First, calculate the dot product between each Query and all Keys. This operation measures how much each key matches the query—essentially, it's checking for relevance or similarity.

2. **Scaling**: Since the dot products might grow large in magnitude (leading to very large exponents during the softmax calculation, which can cause computational problems), we typically scale down the results by dividing by the square root of the dimension of the keys. This makes training more stable.

3. **Softmax**: Apply the softmax function to the scaled dot product results. The softmax function converts the scores into probabilities that sum to one. The scores tell us how important each key is relative to the query. Higher scores get more attention because softmax amplifies differences; the key that matches the query the best (highest dot product score) will have the highest probability.

4. **Multiply by V**: Finally, multiply the softmax probabilities with the Values. This step essentially weights each value by its importance determined by the softmax score.

5. **Summation**: Sum up the weighted values. The result is the output of the attention mechanism for that particular query. It's a single vector that represents a combination of values, focusing more on the more relevant parts as determined by the query-key matching.

### In Formula Terms
Here's what the formula typically looks like:
$$ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V $$
Where \( d_k \) is the dimension of the keys.

## An Analogy
Imagine you are in a busy museum with many different artifacts (each artifact represents a Value). You are curious about a specific topic—say, ancient Egyptian history (your Query). As you walk around, certain artifacts' descriptions (the Keys) catch your eye more than others because they mention Egypt. The relevance of each artifact to your interest in Egypt is like the scores calculated between Q and K. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">You pay more attention to those artifacts, and your memory of the visit (the output) is primarily made up of information from those relevant artifacts.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Artifacts in museum - Values, tied up pieces of information.
Ancient Egyptian history -  Query, the current word / item of interest
Description of articles - Keys, which catch our eyes more.</mark>

- **Values (V)** represent all the available information or data points.
- **Keys (K)** represent aspects or features of this information that can be used to access or retrieve the Values.
- **Queries (Q)** represent the specific piece of information or context you're currently interested in or focusing on.
→ A practical description:
1. **Values (V)**: Each word or token in a sentence might have associated values that represent some aspect of that word, often in the form of vector embeddings that capture its semantic, syntactic, or contextual properties.
    
2. **Keys (K)**: These are also often represented as vectors and are associated with the same words as the Values. However, the purpose of the Keys is to help the model determine how relevant each word (and its corresponding Value) is to the Query.
    
3. **Queries (Q)**: When the model is processing a particular word or looking to generate a word, it formulates a Query. This Query is used to probe the Keys to find out which Values are most relevant.

## How It Works in a Sequence:

Imagine the sentence: "The cat sat on the mat."

- Suppose the model is trying to focus on or generate a word related to "cat."
- The Query would be generated from the context or directly from "cat."
- Each word in the sentence (including "cat") has a Key and a Value.
- The attention mechanism calculates how closely each Key matches the Query (how relevant each word is to "cat").
- It then uses these relevance scores to create a weighted sum of the Values, focusing more on those with higher relevance.

### In Terms of Relevance:

- The **Query** represents the current focus or the specific context/word you're examining or interested in.
- The **Keys** are like indicators or tags that help determine how relevant each piece of information (Value) is to the Query.
- The **Values** are the actual content or information that you might want to bring into focus, weighted by how relevant they are to the Query.

## Interaction with chatgpt as example:

Certainly! Let's explore how the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components of an attention mechanism within a transformer architecture work together, using the interaction between you (the user) and me (an AI based on transformer technology) as an example.

### Setting the Scene:
Imagine our interaction as a dynamic process where you input queries (questions or commands), and I generate responses. Within my transformer architecture, each piece of the conversation is treated as a part of a sequence where both past inputs (questions/commands) and my previous responses contribute to understanding and generating the next part of our dialogue.

### Transformer Architecture:
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms that allow inputs to interact with each other ("self" referring to different positions within the same sequence). In each attention step, Queries, Keys, and Values are derived from these inputs.

### How Q, K, V Work in Our Interaction:

1. **Input Embedding**:
   - Every word or piece of input (from both your queries and my responses) is converted into a numerical form called embeddings. These embeddings are rich in contextual information.

2. **Formation of Q, K, V**:
   - For each word in our ongoing conversation, the transformer model generates Queries, Keys, and Values. These are vectors (lists of numbers) computed from the embeddings.

3. **Self-Attention Calculation**:
   - **Queries**: Each Query vector is generated to explore and identify which parts of the conversation are most relevant to understand the current word or piece of input.
   - **Keys**: Each Key vector represents a part of the conversation and is used to assess its relevance or importance in relation to the Query.
   - **Values**: Each Value vector holds the actual content of each part of the conversation. The content that is deemed relevant through the Query-Key matching will be used to influence the response.

4. **Matching Q to K**:
   - The model calculates the dot product of the Query with all Keys to determine a relevance score for each part of the conversation.
   - These scores are then processed through a softmax function to convert them into a probability distribution, representing the relevance of each part relative to the Query.

5. **Weighting the Vectors**:
   - The softmax scores are used to weight the Values. The more relevant a part of the conversation (as determined by the Query and Key match), the more its Value will influence the current word’s output.

6. **Output Generation**:
   - The weighted sum of the Values, after being influenced by the Query and Key interactions, forms the output for the current input. This output is then transformed through additional neural network layers to generate the final text response that you see.

### Example in Practice:
If you ask, "What did we discuss about the attention mechanism?", my model processes this query to focus attention on previous parts of our conversation where 'attention mechanism' was discussed. The Query for this question would activate Keys associated with relevant past messages, pulling Values that contain information about our discussion on the attention mechanism. This influences the generation of a response that is contextually aware of our prior conversation.

### Conclusion:
In this way, the transformer architecture leverages the Q, K, V attention mechanism to dynamically focus and refocus on different parts of the input based on the current context. This is crucial for maintaining a coherent and contextually relevant dialogue, ensuring that each response is informed by the entire conversation history, not just the immediate last exchange.



In summary, the Q, K, V softmax attention formula helps a model dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, similar to how you might focus your attention in a scenario like visiting a museum.

https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf

"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" is a seminal paper by Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira, published in 2009. It explores the surprising power of large datasets in improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, even when those algorithms are relatively simple.

### Key Points from the Paper:

1. **Power of Data Over Algorithms:**
   - The authors argue that for many practical problems, such as natural language processing and image recognition, having large amounts of data can be more beneficial than using complex algorithms. Simple algorithms, when provided with enough data, often outperform sophisticated models with less data.

2. **Examples in Practice:**
   - They provide examples from Google’s work, such as machine translation and speech recognition, where increasing the size of the training data led to significant performance improvements.

3. **Data Handling:**
   - The paper discusses the challenges and techniques for handling massive datasets, including data cleaning, annotation, and storage.

4. **Empirical Evidence:**
   - It presents empirical evidence that supports the idea that more data leads to better model performance, highlighting the diminishing returns but still consistent improvements as data scales up.

### Implications:

- **Shift in Focus:** The paper suggests a shift in focus towards collecting and utilizing large datasets rather than solely developing more complex algorithms.
- **Practical Applications:** This approach has been influential in practical applications across various domains like search engines, recommendation systems, and social media platforms.

### Further Insights:

- The paper also notes that while having a large dataset is crucial, it is equally important to ensure data quality. Noisy or irrelevant data can hinder model performance despite the volume.

### Current Relevance:

- The principles outlined in "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" remain relevant today, especially in the era of big data and deep learning, where massive datasets are a cornerstone of AI development.
