Here I will update some of the projects that I want to work on. Mostly ML related perhaps. Let's see. Here are some suggestions by chatgpt:
> iris and digit classification, that i already tried with sklearn tutorial.
> cifar-10 by tensorflow - multi-class
> nlp (natural language processing) : Sentiment analysis, for imdb rating etc.
> cluster for some supermarket etc. - to see how to deal with stuffs
> stock prediction, something for later
> movie recommendation, or something similar, that you can do based on previous preferences, historical ratings etc.


These are just some examples and things to do etc. Of course, ground data preparation - truth data, is also a good thing to do, maybe? Accurate and well-labeled data, needed for training and testing of models. Some companies focus exclusively on data annotation and labeling services. Data preprocessing courses are a must. Outsourcing etc.
