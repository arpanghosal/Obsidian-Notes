How to make a good presentation ?
 - have a clear message - keep it clear and terse
 - don't overdo, don't overload slides.
 - interact with audience.
 - message should be clear - why are you doing what you do? do you know well what you are attempting? do you know the consequences? if you change something a little bit, how much would it impact other things? what's the overview? what's the nutshell message from these slides or routines?
 - practice a lot 
 - be engaging toward your audience. Know your audience well. Don't waste their time by showing things they don't care about or probably won't understand.
 - End with a strong call for action. 
 - Elevate your slides with ample visuals and visual hints such as if there are too many things crammed in a single slide, simplify it for audience. Give visual cues. you don't want to lose your audience. Use bullets, highlighting, main takeaway messages, minor and major points, images and charts etc. in case you have an informatively loaded slide.
