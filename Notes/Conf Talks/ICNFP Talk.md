"The high center-of-mass energy of proton-proton collisions and the large available datasets at the CERN Large Hadron Collider allow to study rare processes of the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision and search for new physics that might enhance extremely rare processes in the SM. Measurements of rare SM processes provide new tests of the SM predictions with the potential to unveil discrepancies with the SM predictions or provide important input for the improvement of theoretical calculations. Interesting processes are Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC): forbidden at tree level and highly suppressed at higher orders in the Standard Model (SM), FCNC processes can receive enhanced contributions in many extensions of the SM, so any measurable sign of such interactions is an indication of new physics. In this talk, total and differential measurements of top-quark production in association with additional bosons are shown using data taken with the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV. This included the observation top top+photon production, which is a very rare process discovered for the first time at the LHC. Measurements of production asymmetries in various final states provide precision tests of the SM. In addition, new searches for FCNCs with the ATLAS experiment are shown, using the full data taken during Run-2 of the LHC. Also a search for charged-lepton flavour violation is shown, as well as other searches for beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena in top-quark final states."

## why study top with bosons?
Here are a few reasons why studying the top quark in association with bosons is significant:

1. Testing the Standard Model: The Standard Model of particle physics is the prevailing theory that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. The top quark's interactions with bosons allow us to test the predictions of the Standard Model. By comparing experimental observations with the theoretical expectations, we can check whether the Standard Model accurately describes the behaviour of top quarks and bosons.
    
2. Probing Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: The electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism is responsible for giving mass to the W and Z bosons, as well as generating the masses of other particles through the Higgs mechanism. The top quark has a particularly strong coupling to the Higgs boson, making it an essential player in the process of electroweak symmetry breaking. Studying the top quark's interactions with bosons provides valuable information about this mechanism, which is crucial for understanding the origin of particle masses.
    
3. Constraining Beyond Standard Model Physics: While the Standard Model has been incredibly successful, it is known to be incomplete. Many theories, such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions, propose extensions to the Standard Model. By studying top quark interactions with bosons, we can search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions. Any deviations could be hints of new physics beyond the Standard Model, helping us refine or extend our current understanding of the fundamental particles and forces.
    
4. Investigating Anomalous Couplings: The precise measurements of the top quark's interactions with bosons can shed light on potential anomalous couplings. Anomalous couplings refer to modifications or deviations from the expected coupling strengths predicted by the Standard Model. These couplings could arise from new particles or interactions not accounted for in the Standard Model. By examining the rates and distributions of top quark decays involving bosons, physicists can search for these anomalous couplings and use them as potential probes of new physics.
    
5. Understanding Heavy Particle Production and Decay: The top quark is unique in its extremely short lifetime, decaying before it hadronizes and forms bound states. This property allows us to study the top quark's properties at the quark level directly. By studying its interactions with bosons, we can gain insights into the production mechanisms of heavy particles, as well as the dynamics of their decays. This knowledge is valuable for various areas, such as refining event simulations at particle colliders and improving our understanding of other heavy particles.

## why top in bsm?
In Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories, the top quark often plays a crucial role due to its unique properties and high mass. Here are a few important roles played by the top quark in BSM models:

1. Flavor Physics: The top quark's large mass makes it a valuable probe in studying flavor physics. BSM models often introduce new particles or interactions that can affect the decays and interactions of the top quark, providing opportunities to test the predictions of these theories.
    
2. Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: The top quark's mass is close to the electroweak scale, which makes it significant in models that address the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. BSM theories often propose alternative mechanisms or additional particles that could influence the Higgs boson's properties and its interactions with the top quark.
    
3. Grand Unification: Some BSM models attempt to unify the fundamental forces at high energy scales. In such scenarios, the top quark, being the heaviest known fermion, can play a role in the unification of the gauge couplings and the unification scale.
    
4. Dark Matter: Many BSM theories seek to explain the nature of dark matter, which constitutes a significant portion of the universe's mass. The top quark can be involved in dark matter production, annihilation, or decay processes, depending on the specific model.
    
5. Collider Signatures: The top quark's large mass also makes it an interesting particle to study at high-energy colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). BSM models may predict new particles that can be produced in association with the top quark, leading to distinct experimental signatures that could be detected at colliders.

## VLQ and T vector
Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) are hypothetical particles predicted in various Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. These quarks possess the same gauge quantum numbers as the Standard Model quarks but differ in their chiral properties, meaning they have both left- and right-handed components. VLQs are often introduced to address issues such as the hierarchy problem, the unification of forces, or the nature of dark matter.

In experimental analyses, the presence of VLQs can manifest as deviations from Standard Model predictions in high-energy collisions. To search for VLQs, physicists perform dedicated analyses using data from particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These analyses typically involve the identification and reconstruction of the VLQs' decay products.

One commonly used technique in VLQ analyses is the use of VLQ t vectors. The VLQ t vector is a four-momentum vector associated with the decay products of the VLQ. It represents the momentum and energy of the decay products in the rest frame of the VLQ, enabling physicists to study the kinematics of the VLQ decay.

By reconstructing the VLQ t vectors from the observed decay products, physicists can make kinematical cuts, perform background estimations, and search for signatures of VLQ production. The t vector can help discriminate between signal events (VLQ decays) and background events, improving the sensitivity of the analysis.

Furthermore, the VLQ t vector can be used to extract additional information about the VLQ, such as its mass or spin. By comparing the reconstructed VLQ t vectors with theoretical predictions, physicists can perform precise measurements and test the compatibility of experimental data with different VLQ models.

Overall, VLQ analyses involving t vectors are an important tool in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. They allow for the identification and characterization of VLQs, providing insights into the nature of fundamental particles and potential extensions to our current understanding of particle physics.

Several extensions of the SM, like the quark-singlet model [2], the two-Higgs doublet model with or without flavour-conservation [3–6], SUSY with R-parity violation [7], or composite Higgs models with partial compositeness [8], predict the presence of FCNC contributions already at tree level, and would enhance the top-quark FCNC decay branching fractions by more than ten orders of magnitude. Other extensions of the SM predict the existence of new particles, either a neutral scalar, a pseudoscalar, or an axion-like particle (ALP), which are strongly coupled with third generation quarks and include FCNC couplings with first and second generation quarks.
