### General flow of talk :
Why? and how? 
motivation of the talk - why dipole moments and stuffs, more so what are electric and magnetic dipole moments of quarks? 
Each quark has an electric charge, and because of this charge, each quark also has a dipole moment.
The<span style="color:#f5ed05"> dipole moment of a quark </span>is a measure of the separation between its positive and negative charges. It is a vector quantity that points from the negative to the positive charge. The dipole moment of a quark is a fundamental property of the particle, much like its mass or spin..
the dipole moments of the quarks in a proton or neutron can contribute to the overall magnetic moment of the particle.
chromo means coming from colour charges. how will they combine to give an overall picture remains to be seen.
In QCD, the color charge of quarks can give rise to a phenomenon known as color confinement, which means that isolated quarks cannot exist on their own but must always be found bound inside particles called hadrons. This makes it difficult to define electric and magnetic dipole moments for individual quarks in the same way that it is done for charged particles like electrons.

However, the color charge of quarks can contribute to the electric and magnetic moments of hadrons like protons and neutrons, which are made up of quarks. These moments arise from the motion and orientation of the quarks inside the hadron, as well as from their interactions with the electromagnetic field.

Then I should talk about the calculations available and nlo versus electroweak i should know. 

diagram removal vs. diagram subtraction.
