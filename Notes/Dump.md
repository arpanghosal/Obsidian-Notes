1. **Energy Loss and Bragg Peak:** As these particles travel through matter and ionize atoms, they lose energy. The rate of energy loss per unit distance is described by the Bethe formula. In certain cases, like with protons in therapeutic applications, this energy loss culminates in a Bragg peak, where the maximum energy loss (and thus ionization) occurs just before the particle comes to a stop.

### Muons:

1. **Energy Loss Rate:** High-energy muons (such as those from cosmic rays) typically lose energy at a rate of approximately 2 MeV per gram per square centimeter of matter traversed. This rate is roughly constant for muons with energies above a few GeV in dense materials like rock or water.
    
2. **Mean Free Path:** For ionization interactions, the mean free path of muons in a medium like air is very small, on the order of micrometers. This means they are continuously ionizing atoms as they travel through the atmosphere.
    
3. **Penetration Depth:** Muons from cosmic rays can penetrate deep into the atmosphere. They can travel several kilometers through air, and energetic muons can even penetrate hundreds of meters into rock or water.
    

### Electrons:

1. **Energy Loss:** Electrons lose energy more rapidly than muons due to their lower mass. In air, high-energy electrons typically lose tens of MeV of energy per centimeter of travel.
    
2. **Range:** The range of electrons in air is much shorter than that of muons. For example, a 1 MeV electron will travel only about a few centimeters in air before stopping.


Neutrons, being uncharged, have a longer mean free path in matter compared to charged particles.

A "large radius jet" refers to a jet where the particles are spread out over a larger area. This is often indicative of more complex processes occurring in the collision, such as the decay of a massive particle.

jettiness is a variable used to quantify how jet-like a collection of particles is. It's a way of measuring how well the particles in an event can be grouped into jets.

**Calculation:** Jettiness is calculated based on the distances between particles and proposed jet axes. Lower values of jettiness mean that the particles are more easily grouped into jets, while higher values suggest a less jet-like structure.

## Understanding the Standard Model Lagrangian

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a comprehensive theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe (excluding gravity) and classifies all known elementary particles. The Lagrangian of the Standard Model encapsulates the dynamics of these particles and forces.

### Components of the Standard Model Lagrangian
- **Gauge Bosons**: Represent the force carriers for the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces.
- **Fermions**: Include the matter particles, such as quarks and leptons.
- **Higgs Boson**: Responsible for giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism.

### Symmetry Principles
The SM is built on the principles of gauge symmetry, particularly the groups $$ U(1) $$, $$ SU(2) $$, and $$ SU(3) $$. These symmetries dictate the interactions between particles.

### Key Aspects of the Lagrangian
The full Lagrangian of the Standard Model is complex, but can be broadly divided into:
1. **Gauge Field Terms**: Describing the dynamics of gauge bosons.
2. **Matter Field Terms**: Describing the behavior of fermions.
3. **Higgs Field Term**: Detailing the Higgs field and its interactions.
4. **Yukawa Interactions**: Describing how fermions obtain mass through interactions with the Higgs field.
5. **Covariant Derivatives**: Incorporating the interactions between fermions and gauge bosons.

### Simplified Example
A highly simplified version of the SM Lagrangian, focusing on the electromagnetic interaction, is:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi
$$

Where:
- $$ F_{\mu\nu} $$ represents the electromagnetic field tensor.
- $$ \psi $$ represents the fermion fields (like electrons).
- $$ \gamma^\mu $$ are the gamma matrices related to spin.
- $$ D_\mu $$ is the covariant derivative, incorporating the interaction with the electromagnetic field.
- $$ m $$ is the mass of the fermion.

## Conclusion
The Standard Model's Lagrangian is foundational in particle physics, representing decades of theoretical development and experimental verification. The full expression is complex, requiring a deep understanding of quantum field theory.

Miscellaneous : 

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe (excluding gravity) and classifies all known elementary particles. The Lagrangian of the Standard Model is a formula that encapsulates all the dynamics of these particles and forces. It's a highly complex and comprehensive expression, reflecting the depth and complexity of the theory.

### Understanding the Standard Model Lagrangian

1. **Components**: The SM Lagrangian is made up of several parts, each corresponding to different forces and particles:
   - **Gauge Bosons**: The force carriers for the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces.
   - **Fermions**: The matter particles, including quarks and leptons.
   - **Higgs Boson**: A particle responsible for giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism.

2. **Symmetry Principles**: The SM is built on the principles of gauge symmetry, particularly the groups \( U(1) \), \( SU(2) \), and \( SU(3) \). These symmetries dictate the form of the interactions between particles.

3. **Electroweak Unification**: The electromagnetic and weak forces are unified in the SM through the \( SU(2) \times U(1) \) electroweak interaction.

4. **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: The theory of the strong force, described by the \( SU(3) \) gauge symmetry, governing the interactions between quarks and gluons.

### The Form of the Lagrangian

The full Lagrangian of the Standard Model is quite lengthy and complex. At a high level, it can be broken down into several terms:

1. **Gauge Field Terms**: Describe the dynamics of the gauge bosons.
2. **Matter Field Terms**: Describe the behavior of fermions.
3. **Higgs Field Term**: Describes the Higgs field and its interactions.
4. **Yukawa Interactions**: Describe how fermions obtain mass via interactions with the Higgs field.
5. **Covariant Derivatives**: Incorporate the interactions between fermions and gauge bosons.

### Simplified Example

A very simplified and not exhaustive version of the SM Lagrangian, focusing just on the electromagnetic interaction, looks something like this:

\[ \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi \]

Where:
- \( F_{\mu\nu} \) represents the electromagnetic field tensor.
- \( \psi \) represents the fermion fields (like electrons).
- \( \gamma^\mu \) are the gamma matrices related to spin.
- \( D_\mu \) is the covariant derivative incorporating the interaction with the electromagnetic field.
- \( m \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Conclusion

The Standard Model's Lagrangian is the foundation of our understanding of fundamental particles and forces (except for gravity). It is a product of decades of theoretical development and experimental verification. The full expression is complex and requires a deep understanding of quantum field theory to fully appreciate. However, even the simplified form above gives a sense of how the SM combines various elements to describe the rich tapestry of particle physics.
