Nihilism as a philosophical perspective has evolved over time and can be traced to several key thinkers and movements. It's important to note that nihilism is not a monolithic ideology; it encompasses a range of beliefs and interpretations. Here's an overview of the origins, proponents, opponents, arguments, and ways individuals may reconcile nihilistic impulses with life's ambitions:

**Origins of Nihilism**:
- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Nietzsche is often associated with the exploration of nihilism in his works, particularly in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" and "The Will to Power." He critiqued the consequences of the "death of God" and the erosion of traditional values, which he saw as leading to nihilism.

- **Ivan Turgenev**: The Russian novelist Turgenev introduced the term "nihilism" in his novel "Fathers and Sons" (1862). In the context of the novel, nihilism represented a rejection of traditional authority and values.

**Proponents of Nihilism**:
- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: While Nietzsche is often seen as a critic of nihilism, he is also considered one of its proponents in the sense that he explored its implications and consequences. He believed that confronting nihilism was essential for individuals to create their own values.

**Opponents of Nihilism**:
- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Nietzsche's work can be seen as both exploring nihilism and opposing it. He criticized the passive acceptance of nihilism and advocated for the creation of new, life-affirming values.

- **Existentialist Philosophers**: Existentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus opposed nihilism by emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility, meaning-making, and the absurdity of existence. They argued that individuals can find purpose and create meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe.

**Arguments For Nihilism**:
- **Critique of Traditional Values**: Nihilism often critiques traditional values, ideologies, and religious beliefs, asserting that they lack a rational or objective basis.

- **Emphasis on Skepticism**: Nihilism encourages skepticism and questioning of assumed truths, promoting intellectual independence and critical thinking.

**Arguments Against Nihilism**:
- **Loss of Meaning and Purpose**: Critics argue that nihilism can lead to a sense of despair and meaninglessness, which can be psychologically harmful.

- **Moral and Ethical Concerns**: Some opponents of nihilism argue that a rejection of moral values can lead to ethical relativism, potentially justifying harmful behaviors.

**Reconciling Nihilistic Impulses with Ambitions**:
- **Existentialism**: Existentialist philosophy offers a path for reconciling nihilistic impulses with life's ambitions. Existentialists suggest that individuals have the freedom to create their own meaning and values in an otherwise indifferent universe. This involves embracing one's agency and making choices that give life purpose and significance.

- **Absurdism**: Albert Camus' philosophy of absurdism acknowledges the inherent absurdity and meaninglessness of existence but encourages individuals to confront this absurdity with defiance and an acknowledgment of the value of the human spirit.

- **Positive Nihilism**: Some individuals adopt a perspective known as "positive nihilism," which involves accepting the absence of inherent meaning while choosing to live a life that aligns with personal values, goals, and ambitions. It's about finding subjective meaning and fulfillment despite the absence of objective meaning.

In essence, while nihilism challenges traditional beliefs and can lead to a sense of existential crisis, it does not dictate a particular course of action. Individuals can explore different philosophical frameworks, seek personal meaning and purpose, and engage in meaningful pursuits that align with their values and ambitions. The reconciliation of nihilistic impulses with life's ambitions often involves a journey of self-exploration and the creation of individualized meaning and values.


## Absurdity of existence:  #absurdism
**Absurdism** is a philosophical perspective that addresses the apparent conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the inherent meaninglessness of the universe. It is often associated with existentialism and can be summarized as follows:

**Main Philosophical Underpinnings**:
- **Existentialist Roots**: Absurdism shares similarities with existentialism, particularly in its focus on individual experience and choice.
- **Absurdity of Existence**: It emphasizes the inherent absurdity and lack of rational meaning in life's experiences.

**Main Features**:
- **Conflict**: Absurdism highlights the tension between humans' desire for meaning and the indifference of the universe.
- **Absurdity**: Life's situations are often seen as absurd, irrational, and devoid of inherent purpose or value.
- **Rebellion**: Absurdists advocate for rebellion against the absurdity by embracing the act of living and making choices despite the lack of ultimate meaning.

**Different Positions**:
- **Acceptance**: Some adopt an attitude of acceptance, acknowledging life's absurdity but choosing to live authentically and find meaning in the human experience.
- **Rebellion**: Others engage in active rebellion against the absurdity, striving to create their own values and purpose in defiance of the irrationality of existence.

**Leading Proponents**:
- **Albert Camus**: Camus is a central figure in absurdism. His essay "The Myth of Sisyphus" explores the human predicament of facing an indifferent universe and suggests that one must imagine Sisyphus happy as he embraces his futile task.

- **Franz Kafka**: While not an explicit absurdist, Kafka's works, such as "The Metamorphosis" and "The Trial," often depict surreal and absurd situations that reflect the human condition.

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: Sartre, known for his existentialist philosophy, also engaged with the absurd in works like "Nausea," which portrays the absurdity of everyday existence.

- **Samuel Beckett**: Beckett's play "Waiting for Godot" is a classic example of absurdist theater, highlighting the meaninglessness of existence through the absurd interactions of its characters.

Absurdism offers a perspective that acknowledges the chaos and absurdity of life while advocating for a meaningful and authentic engagement with existence. It encourages individuals to confront the absurdity of the universe with courage and creativity, finding value in the very act of living and making choices.


According to Thomas Nagel, there may be, at least theoretically, two responses to actually resolving the problem of the absurd. This is based on the idea that the absurd arises from the consciousness of a conflict between two aspects of human life: that humans care about various things and that the world seems arbitrary and does not merit this concern. The absurd would not arise if either of the conflicting elements would cease to exist, i.e. if the individual would stop caring about things, as some Eastern religions seem to suggest, or if one could find something that possesses a non-arbitrary meaning that merits the concern. For theorists who give importance to the consciousness of this conflict for the absurd, a further option presents itself: to remain ignorant of it to the extent that this is possible.
