## Intro :

Taken below is from a cern excerpt :
"It is necessary to establish a fresh framework that goes beyond the traditional interpretation of Higgs production rates and incorporates shape information, Higgs self-interaction rates and other SM processes including Electroweak precision data and also analyses of processes including top quarks production.

The absence of definitive signals indicating physics beyond the SM at the LHC suggests the possibility of a scale separation between the SM and any potential new physics at higher energies. This motivates the utilization of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) [[20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08945)] as a valuable tool for indirectly searching for new physics in LHC data [read also a previous [EP news article](https://ep-news.web.cern.ch/content/lhc-takes-smeft-challenge)]. The SMEFT offers the advantages of (near) model-independence, systematic improvement capabilities, and the ability to simultaneously leverage multiple datasets.

Effective Filed theories introduce new-physics states at a high mass scale Λ, significantly larger than the electroweak scale. By expanding in terms of E/Λ, where E represents the typical energy exchanged in a process, the theory provides predictions for experimental observables. This expansion is achieved through a series of operators, which are constructed as gauge-invariant combinations of SM fields with energy dimensions greater than four.

By measuring observables that are sensitive to the effects of SMEFT operators, it becomes possible to constrain the values of c(d)/Λ4d, where c(d)) represents the Wilson coefficients associated with the dimension-d operators O(d). The leading effects of new physics are expected to be captured by dimension-six operators, as higher-dimensional operators are suppressed by greater powers of Λ−1. The extensive measurements conducted by ATLAS, focusing on electroweak interactions, the Higgs boson, and top quarks, exhibit sensitivity to a wide range of operators that impact various aspects of particle interactions. These operators influence Higgs boson couplings, self-interactions of weak bosons, couplings between weak bosons and fermions, as well as four-fermion couplings. To achieve the best possible sensitivity and disentangle the effects of these operators, it is necessary to combine a diverse set of measurements. A first measurement has been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration with the Run2 data [[21](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2816369/files/ATL-PHYS-PUB-2022-037.pdf)]. Also CP violating effects can be included.

Conducting a global analysis of constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the SMEFT is of utmost importance when allowing more than a few Wilson coefficients to be non-zero. This is due to the fact that numerous SMEFT operators contribute to multiple observables, emphasizing the need to avoid analyzing different measurement classes in isolation. This feature becomes increasingly important as the statistics of the ATLAS data increases. During the analysis of Run 3, a significant emphasis will be placed on utilizing Effective Field Theories (EFTs). This endeavor holds particular significance as it aims to uncover potential deviations from the Standard Model (SM) that could be amplified through the comprehensive interpretation of diverse measurements. Furthermore, the outcomes of these investigations will play a crucial role in guiding our future research endeavors at the HL-LHC."

## Basics of EFT (with examples):

Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a powerful framework used in theoretical physics to describe phenomena at a given energy scale, while "integrating out" or ignoring the details of the underlying higher-energy or shorter-distance scales. This concept can be applied to a wide range of contexts, from particle physics to condensed matter.

### Basic Idea

Imagine you're watching a movie on an old TV screen. If you stand too close, you see individual pixels, but if you step back, you see a clear picture. EFT works similarly. Instead of focusing on every detail (or every pixel), it gives us the big picture.

In EFT, we ignore the details of some high-energy interactions and only focus on long-range or low-energy processes.

### Formalism

The idea is to express the Lagrangian (a mathematical object that describes the dynamics of a system) in terms of fields that are relevant at the scale of interest. The Lagrangian will have a series of terms, organized by their dimension:

LEFT=LSM+1ΛL5+1Λ2L6+…LEFT​=LSM​+Λ1​L5​+Λ21​L6​+…

Here:

- LSMLSM​ is the Standard Model Lagrangian or some other low-energy Lagrangian.
- ΛΛ is the "cutoff" scale, where new physics might appear.
- L5L5​, L6L6​, etc., are operators of higher dimension which are suppressed by the corresponding powers of ΛΛ.

### Application

Let's discuss one of the most famous examples: Fermi's theory of beta decay. Before the discovery of the W and Z bosons, Fermi described weak interactions in terms of a four-fermion interaction. This interaction looked like direct contact between particles, with no mediator.

The Fermi interaction had the form:

LFermi=GF2ψˉνγμ(1−γ5)ψeψˉnγμ(1−γ5)ψpLFermi​=2

​GF​​ψˉ​ν​γμ(1−γ5​)ψe​ψˉ​n​γμ​(1−γ5​)ψp​

Where GFGF​ is Fermi's constant, and the ψψ terms represent various fermion fields.

Later, it was discovered that this interaction was actually mediated by the exchange of a W boson. However, for energies much less than the W boson mass, the Fermi theory provides a good approximation.

### Why is EFT Powerful?

1. **Separation of Scales**: We can effectively deal with physics at a particular scale without knowing the details of higher scales.
    
2. **Universality**: EFTs can describe a broad class of underlying theories, as long as they have the same symmetries and particle content at low energies.
    
3. **Systematic Improvements**: If we want to refine our predictions, we can systematically include higher-dimensional operators, suppressed by higher powers of the scale ΛΛ.
    

### Limitations

- **Accuracy**: The accuracy is restricted to a specific range of energy scales.
    
- **New Physics**: EFT cannot predict new particles or phenomena but can hint at their presence through deviations from expected results.
    

### In Conclusion

Effective Field Theories are a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics, providing a systematic way to describe phenomena when a full microscopic description is either unknown or too complicated to handle. They are widely used in particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics. The ability to "integrate out" high-energy details and focus on relevant low-energy processes is what makes EFTs incredibly versatile and powerful.

## Description
In the context of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, the approach often involves considering the possible existence of heavier, as-yet-undiscovered particles. These particles, though not directly observable with current technology, might still influence the interactions and behaviors of particles that are part of the Standard Model (SM). To account for these potential effects, new terms are added to the SM Lagrangian. These terms typically manifest as higher-dimensional operators, often of dimension-six or higher, which describe the hypothesized interactions between BSM particles and known SM particles.

### Experimentally Finding and Measuring These Couplings

1. **High-Energy Particle Collisions**: Experiments at particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), can provide insights. By colliding particles at very high energies, physicists can probe for deviations from the SM predictions that might hint at the influence of BSM physics.

2. **Precision Measurements**: Precise measurements of known processes can reveal discrepancies with SM predictions. For instance, precise measurements of the magnetic moment of particles, decay rates, or scattering cross-sections can show deviations that might be attributable to higher-dimensional operators.

3. **Parameterization**: In theoretical models, these new couplings are often parameterized in terms of their strength and the energy scale at which they become relevant. The coefficients of these higher-dimensional operators (which represent the strength of the new couplings) are crucial parameters. They are typically expressed as a ratio where the numerator represents the strength of the interaction, and the denominator includes the new physics energy scale, often represented by Λ.

### Theoretical Values and Conjectures

1. **Effective Field Theory (EFT)**: The framework used to describe these interactions is known as Effective Field Theory. EFT allows physicists to systematically include the effects of high-energy physics in low-energy observations by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian.

2. **Theoretical Predictions**: Theoretical values for the coefficients of these new terms are often based on various BSM theories. These theories might suggest specific forms for the new interactions and provide a range of expected values for their strengths.

3. **Matching and Running**: Theoretical approaches like 'matching' (connecting BSM theories with the effective theory at a high energy scale) and 'running' (using renormalization group equations to understand how these parameters change with energy) are employed to make predictions.

4. **Conjectures and Hypotheses**: It's important to note that many of these theoretical values are conjectural. They are based on extensions of the SM that have not yet been experimentally confirmed. They serve as guidelines for what physicists might expect to find in experiments.

In summary, the search for BSM physics involves both theoretical predictions based on extensions of the SM and experimental efforts to find deviations from SM predictions. The process of identifying these new couplings and measuring their strengths is ongoing and represents a significant part of current research in particle physics.

## Conflating EFT and renormalization : 
Effective Field Theory (EFT) and renormalization are deeply connected concepts, and they share some similarities in philosophy, but they are used for different purposes.

### Renormalization

Renormalization is a procedure to deal with the divergences that arise in the perturbative evaluation of quantum field theory (QFT) observables, especially in the context of the Standard Model (SM). When we calculate certain quantities in QFT using Feynman diagrams, we sometimes encounter infinite results, which are physically nonsensical. Renormalization provides a systematic way to absorb these infinities into the redefinition of parameters (like masses and couplings) of the theory, making predictions finite and physically meaningful.

### EFT and Renormalization

Effective Field Theories are based on the same basic idea as renormalization: separating different energy scales. Just like in renormalization, where we absorb high-energy or short-distance information into redefined parameters, in EFT we "integrate out" the high-energy or short-distance degrees of freedom to focus on the low-energy or long-distance physics.

However, while renormalization is about handling infinities and making QFT calculations meaningful, EFT is about simplifying the description of a system by focusing on the relevant degrees of freedom at a particular energy scale.

### Relationship with the Standard Model

When we use EFT in the context of the SM, it's often to describe physics that might exist beyond the SM. Since we don't know the exact form of a potential "Beyond the Standard Model" (BSM) theory, we use EFT to parametrize our ignorance. We add to the SM Lagrangian all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the SM symmetries, suppressed by powers of a scale ΛΛ which is the energy scale of the new physics.

As we perform calculations in this EFT, we might encounter divergences. Here's where renormalization comes in again. The renormalization process in EFT can give us insights about the structure of the UV (ultraviolet, or high-energy) completion of the theory - the more fundamental theory that the EFT is an approximation of.

### In Summary

- **Renormalization** is a technique to handle infinities in QFT calculations.
- **EFT** is a framework to describe physics at a given energy scale by integrating out higher energy scales.
- Both concepts involve the idea of separating or handling different energy scales in a QFT.
- EFT allows for a parametrized description of unknown higher-scale physics, like BSM physics. When performing calculations in such an EFT, renormalization techniques might be needed.
### Relationship with Renormalization:

When we do loop calculations in an EFT, we again encounter divergences, but some of these can be absorbed by redefining the coefficients of the higher-dimensional operators (similar to how we redefine mass and charge in QED). If an EFT is well-defined, any observable we compute should be independent of the scale at which we separate "low-energy" from "high-energy."

For instance, when doing calculations in the Fermi theory, we'd encounter divergences that would be absorbed by redefining the Fermi constant, GFGF​. However, if we were doing the calculations in the full theory with the W boson, these divergences would be absorbed into the definitions of other parameters, like the W boson mass or the weak coupling constant.

In essence, while both renormalization and EFT involve separating or handling different energy scales, the former deals directly with the divergences of QFT, while the latter offers a simplified description of phenomena by ignoring high-energy details. Both are crucial for making meaningful and accurate predictions in particle physics.

$\[ e(\mu) = Z_e(\mu) e_{\text{bare}} \]$

## Renormalization

In quantum field theory, infinities might arise when you calculate certain quantities. Renormalization is a procedure to rid the theory of these infinities.

The basic idea is:

$$ e(\mu) = Z_e(\mu) e_{\text{bare}} $$

$$ e(\mu) = Z_e(\mu) e_{\text{bare}} $$

Where:
- $e(\mu)$ is the renormalized charge.
- $e_{\text{bare}}$ is the bare charge.
- $Z_e(\mu)$ is the renormalization constant.

## Effective Field Theory (EFT)

EFT is a way to describe physical phenomena at a particular scale. The Lagrangian for an EFT is:


$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{EFT}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} + \sum_i \frac{c_i}{\Lambda^{d_i}} \mathcal{O}_i $$


Where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}$ is the Standard Model Lagrangian.
- $\mathcal{O}_i$ are operators representing new interactions.
- $c_i$ are the coefficients.
- $\Lambda$ is the scale of new physics.
- $d_i$ is the dimension of the operator $\mathcal{O}_i$.

## Integrating out heavy terms in SM L:
The passage you've shared relates to a concept in high-energy physics, particularly in the context of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It's a bit technical, so I'll break it down step by step:

1. **High-Energy Physics and Heavy Degrees of Freedom**: In particle physics, "degrees of freedom" generally refer to independent physical parameters that define the state of a system. In high-energy physics, these might include particles or fields that are too massive (or "heavy") to be directly observed or produced in current experiments.

2. **Integrating Out Heavy Degrees of Freedom**: When these heavy particles cannot be directly observed or produced (due to limitations in energy), physicists use a technique where they "integrate out" these heavy degrees of freedom. This means they mathematically remove these variables from the equations that describe particle interactions, simplifying the model while still accounting for the effects these heavy particles would have.

3. **New Terms in the SM Lagrangian**: The Standard Model is described by a mathematical structure called the Lagrangian, which encapsulates the dynamics of particles and fields. When heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out, new terms are added to this Lagrangian. These new terms are made up of "higher-dimensional operators" - mathematical entities that describe interactions not accounted for in the original framework of the SM.

4. **Suppression by Λ**: The influence of these new terms is suppressed by the inverse power of a scale Λ (Lambda), which is characteristic of the energy scale of the heavy particles. The higher the energy scale, the less significant these terms are at lower energies.

5. **Respecting Symmetries and Conservation Laws**: These new terms still respect the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model, such as Lorentz invariance (the laws of physics are the same regardless of how you're moving) and SM gauge symmetries (related to the fundamental forces), as well as conservation laws like baryon and lepton number conservation.

6. **Effects After Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB)**: After EWSB, a key process in particle physics where the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces become distinct, these integrated-out terms lead to new couplings - new ways in which particles can interact. These new interactions are not part of the SM at tree level (the simplest level of particle interaction diagrams).

7. **New Interactions**: This can include interactions like electric and magnetic dipole moments (properties of particles that describe how they interact with electromagnetic fields) that don't exist in the basic SM, as well as modifications to existing SM interactions.

In summary, integrating out heavy degrees of freedom is a way to simplify the models of particle physics while still accounting for the potential effects of particles and fields that cannot be directly observed or produced at current energy levels. This leads to modifications of the Standard Model, which can have observable consequences at lower energies.

# Cedm and Cmdm:

## Definitions:
- **cEDM (chromoelectric dipole moment)**: It is a measure of the distribution of charge within a particle in the presence of a chromoelectric field (related to the strong force in quantum chromodynamics). It represents a CP-violating property, meaning it differs under the combined operations of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformation.
    The CEDM contribution in the SM arises from the three-loop diagrams and has been shown to be very small. 
- **cMDM (chromomagnetic dipole moment)**: It quantifies the distribution of magnetic properties within a particle under the influence of a chromomagnetic field (again related to the strong force). It's analogous to the magnetic dipole moment in electromagnetism but in the context of the strong nuclear force.
## Values:
In the context of the Standard Model of particle physics, both the chromoelectric dipole moment (cEDM) and the chromomagnetic dipole moment (cMDM) of particles are expected to be very small, but there are some key differences in their theoretical expectations:

1. **cEDM**: The cEDM is particularly interesting because it violates CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity). In the Standard Model, CP violation is a very rare phenomenon, observed in certain weak interactions but not in strong interactions. As a result, the cEDM, which would represent CP violation in the context of the strong force (quantum chromodynamics, QCD), is expected to be extremely small or even zero within the Standard Model framework.
    
2. **cMDM**: The cMDM, analogous to the magnetic dipole moment but for the strong force, doesn't necessarily imply CP violation. It can exist within the Standard Model without violating any fundamental symmetries. However, the value of cMDM in the Standard Model is also expected to be quite small, primarily due to the strong force's inherently short range and the confining nature of QCD.

# gtt vertex and the effects: 
from roknabadi and estesami

![[Pasted image 20231128104545.png]]

The context here is the calculation of the chromomagnetic dipole moment (CMDM) of the top quark in the Standard Model (SM), particularly in relation to the \( gtt \) vertex, where \( g \) stands for a gluon and \( tt \) represents the top quark-antiquark pair. This involves evaluating Feynman diagrams that contribute to the CMDM at one-loop level. Let's break down the key points:

1. **CMDM of the Top Quark**: The CMDM is a quantum property of quarks, akin to the magnetic dipole moment but in the realm of the strong interaction. For the top quark, this property can have significant contributions because the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle, and its interactions might include effects beyond the simplest predictions of the SM.

2. **One-Loop Diagrams**: The calculation involves considering corrections to the \( gtt \) vertex at the one-loop level. In quantum field theory, one-loop diagrams are a first-order approximation beyond the simplest (tree-level) interaction. They can provide significant corrections to the properties of particles, especially for the top quark.

3. **QCD and Electroweak Contributions**: These one-loop diagrams include both Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and electroweak interactions. QCD is the theory of the strong force, which governs the interactions of quarks and gluons, while electroweak interactions involve the weak force and electromagnetism.

4. **Types of QCD Diagrams**:
    - **Diagram with External Gluon Emitted from Internal Top Quark**: This Feynman diagram represents a process where the top quark emits and reabsorbs a gluon (the mediator of the strong force), and an additional gluon (the external gluon) is emitted from this internal top quark line.
    - **Diagram with External Gluon from Exchanged Gluon**: This involves the non-Abelian nature of QCD (meaning gluons can interact with each other). In this diagram, the top quark exchanges a gluon with another quark or gluon, and the external gluon is emitted from this exchanged gluon. This is a unique feature of QCD, differentiating it from electromagnetism where photons do not interact with each other.

5. **Non-Abelian Properties of Strong Interaction**: QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, meaning that its force carriers (gluons) can interact with each other. This property leads to complex dynamics and is crucial in the behavior of the strong force.

The CMDM of the top quark is a subject of interest because its measurement and theoretical calculation can provide insights into the SM and potential new physics. Deviations from the predicted CMDM value could indicate physics beyond the SM, making precise calculations and measurements important for the ongoing exploration of fundamental particle physics.



When discussing the "effects" that might be included in the interactions of the top quark beyond the simplest predictions of the Standard Model (SM), we are referring to various potential phenomena or modifications in particle behavior that are not fully accounted for in the current framework of the SM. These effects can be diverse in nature and may include:

1. **New Types of Interactions**: Beyond the known electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, there could be additional forces or interaction types that have not yet been discovered. These new interactions might become apparent only under certain conditions, such as at the high energy scales associated with the top quark.

2. **Anomalous Couplings**: The top quark might exhibit anomalous couplings that differ from those predicted by the SM. This could include unexpected strengths or forms of its interactions with other particles, like gluons, W/Z bosons, or the Higgs boson.

3. **Higher-Order Effects**: The top quark's large mass makes it susceptible to significant loop-level corrections (quantum effects that occur at higher orders in perturbation theory). These effects can modify the properties and interactions of the top quark in ways not fully predicted by the tree-level (simplest) calculations of the SM.

4. **CP Violation**: While the SM does include CP violation (where a process does not produce the same outcome if both charge and parity are inverted), the amount of CP violation predicted by the SM is insufficient to explain certain observed phenomena, like the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The top quark, due to its unique properties, might exhibit additional CP-violating effects.

5. **Mixing with Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Particles**: The top quark might mix or interact with hypothetical particles predicted by theories beyond the SM, such as supersymmetric particles or other exotic forms of matter. These interactions could alter the decay patterns, production rates, or other observable properties of the top quark.

6. **Quantum Gravity Effects**: At the energy scales relevant to the top quark, some theories suggest that effects of quantum gravity might start to become significant. While this is highly speculative, it's a potential area of exploration.

7. **Flavor Physics**: The top quark plays a unique role in the flavor physics of quarks (how different types of quarks transform into each other). There might be effects related to flavor that are not fully captured by the SM, especially considering the top quark's role in electroweak symmetry breaking.

In summary, the nature of these effects could range from modifications in the strength and form of known interactions, to entirely new phenomena that would require extensions to the SM. Studying the top quark is particularly interesting because its large mass suggests it could be sensitive to such new physics, making it a key focus in particle physics research.
