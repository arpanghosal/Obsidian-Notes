### measuring strong force with Z-bosons:
Z bosons are typically produced when two quarks in the colliding protons annihilate. In this weak-interaction process, the strong force comes into play through the radiation of gluons off the annihilating quarks. This radiation gives the Z boson a “kick” transverse to the collision axis (transverse momentum). The magnitude of this kick depends on the strong coupling constant. A precise measurement of the distribution of Z-boson transverse momenta and a comparison with equally precise theoretical calculations of this distribution allows the strong coupling constant to be determined.

"We choose multiple H signal samples and then do analytic fits. 
For signal we choose DS crystall ball with Gaussian center and falling tails. 
Similarly something for the bkg we have templates from data-driven estimates, MC etc."

There are boosted taggers for jets, there are top taggers as well.
