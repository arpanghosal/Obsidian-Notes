"It is necessary to establish a fresh framework that goes beyond the traditional interpretation of Higgs production rates and incorporates shape information, Higgs self-interaction rates and other SM processes including Electroweak precision data and also analyses of processes including top quarks production.

The absence of definitive signals indicating physics beyond the SM at the LHC suggests the possibility of a scale separation between the SM and any potential new physics at higher energies. This motivates the utilization of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) [[20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08945)] as a valuable tool for indirectly searching for new physics in LHC data [read also a previous [EP news article](https://ep-news.web.cern.ch/content/lhc-takes-smeft-challenge)]. The SMEFT offers the advantages of (near) model-independence, systematic improvement capabilities, and the ability to simultaneously leverage multiple datasets.

Effective Filed theories introduce new-physics states at a high mass scale Λ, significantly larger than the electroweak scale. By expanding in terms of E/Λ, where E represents the typical energy exchanged in a process, the theory provides predictions for experimental observables. This expansion is achieved through a series of operators, which are constructed as gauge-invariant combinations of SM fields with energy dimensions greater than four.

By measuring observables that are sensitive to the effects of SMEFT operators, it becomes possible to constrain the values of c(d)/Λ4d, where c(d)) represents the Wilson coefficients associated with the dimension-d operators O(d). The leading effects of new physics are expected to be captured by dimension-six operators, as higher-dimensional operators are suppressed by greater powers of Λ−1. The extensive measurements conducted by ATLAS, focusing on electroweak interactions, the Higgs boson, and top quarks, exhibit sensitivity to a wide range of operators that impact various aspects of particle interactions. These operators influence Higgs boson couplings, self-interactions of weak bosons, couplings between weak bosons and fermions, as well as four-fermion couplings. To achieve the best possible sensitivity and disentangle the effects of these operators, it is necessary to combine a diverse set of measurements. A first measurement has been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration with the Run2 data [[21](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2816369/files/ATL-PHYS-PUB-2022-037.pdf)]. Also CP violating effects can be included.

Conducting a global analysis of constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the SMEFT is of utmost importance when allowing more than a few Wilson coefficients to be non-zero. This is due to the fact that numerous SMEFT operators contribute to multiple observables, emphasizing the need to avoid analyzing different measurement classes in isolation. This feature becomes increasingly important as the statistics of the ATLAS data increases. During the analysis of Run 3, a significant emphasis will be placed on utilizing Effective Field Theories (EFTs). This endeavor holds particular significance as it aims to uncover potential deviations from the Standard Model (SM) that could be amplified through the comprehensive interpretation of diverse measurements. Furthermore, the outcomes of these investigations will play a crucial role in guiding our future research endeavors at the HL-LHC."
