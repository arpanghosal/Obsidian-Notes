In particle physics, cross section is a measure of the probability that a particle interaction will occur. It is typically measured in units of area (e.g. barns), and represents the effective area of the target particle that the incident particle interacts with.

The event number, on the other hand, is a measure of the number of particle interactions that have been observed in an experiment.

The relationship between event number and cross section depends on the specific experimental setup and the physics being studied. However, in general, the cross section can be calculated from the event number using the following formula:

cross section = event number / (luminosity x efficiency)

where luminosity is a measure of the intensity of the particle beam, and efficiency is the fraction of interactions that are successfully detected by the experiment.



The product of luminosity and efficiency is often referred to as the normalization factor. The normalization factor is used to convert the number of observed events in an experiment to a physical cross section measurement.

Luminosity is a measure of the number of particles passing through a unit area per unit time, and is typically expressed in units of inverse area-time, such as cm^-2 s^-1. Efficiency is the fraction of events that are detected by the experiment, and is typically determined through simulation or calibration studies.

The normalization factor takes into account both the intensity of the particle beam (luminosity) and the effectiveness of the experimental setup at detecting events (efficiency). By multiplying the observed event rate by the normalization factor, the resulting cross section measurement is independent of the experimental conditions and can be compared to theoretical predictions or other experimental results.

It is worth noting that the determination of the normalization factor can be a significant source of uncertainty in cross section measurements, and careful calibration and control of systematic effects is necessary to achieve precise and accurate results.

Event weights are factors used to adjust the simulated event samples to better match the expected distribution of events in real data. These weights are typically applied to simulated events during analysis, and can affect the calculation of event numbers and efficiencies.
Event weights are used to correct for various effects, such as detector response, reconstruction efficiencies, and event selection criteria, that may not be perfectly modeled in the simulated event samples. By adjusting the weights of simulated events, the distribution of events in the simulated samples can be made to better match the distribution of events in real data.
The effect of event weights on event numbers and efficiency can depend on the specific analysis being performed. In some cases, event weights may be used to correct for differences in the detection efficiency between real data and simulated events, which can affect the calculation of efficiency. In other cases, event weights may be used to adjust the number of simulated events in certain regions of phase space to better match the expected distribution of events in real data, which can affect the calculation of event numbers.

The normalization factor used to convert the number of observed events in an experiment to a physical cross section measurement is subject to various sources of uncertainty, which can contribute to the overall uncertainty in the cross section measurement.

The uncertainty in the luminosity measurement, for example, can be a significant source of uncertainty in the normalization factor. The luminosity measurement can be affected by various factors, such as beam conditions, detector response, and calibration, and the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement can propagate to the uncertainty in the normalization factor and the resulting cross section measurement.

The efficiency measurement can also contribute to the uncertainty in the normalization factor. The efficiency measurement can be affected by various factors, such as detector response, trigger efficiency, and event selection criteria, and the uncertainty in the efficiency measurement can propagate to the uncertainty in the normalization factor and the resulting cross section measurement.

In addition to these sources of uncertainty, there can be other sources of systematic uncertainty, such as uncertainties in the simulation of the particle interactions, detector response, and event reconstruction. These systematic uncertainties can also contribute to the overall uncertainty in the cross section measurement.
